====== PHP RFC: New core autoloading mechanism with support for function autoloading ======

  * Version: 0.1
  * Date: 2022-12-06
  * Author: George Peter Banyard, <girgias@php.net>
  * Status: Draft
  * Target Version: PHP 8.3
  * Implementation: [[https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/8294]]
  * First Published at: [[http://wiki.php.net/rfc/core-autoloading]]

===== Introduction =====

PHP has had support for class autoloading since PHP 5 and is an extremely useful feature that is relied on to only load classes that are being used within the current request. However, the current autoloading does not support autoloading functions.

The need for such a feature seems very clear as users will create "helper" classes with static methods to take advantage of autoloading via the class autoloading mechanism.

A previous [[draft RFC for function autoloading|https://wiki.php.net/rfc/function_autoloading]] did not proceed to a vote, due to concerns on a performance hit related to global functions. This RFC has avoided that performance problem.

This RFC proposes the introduction of autoloading for functions and an updated mechanism for classes which addresses some minor design issues with the current SPL design.

===== Proposal =====

The proposal consists of adding a better designed class autoloading mechanism and a new function autoloading mechanism, and aliasing the existing autoload functions to the new versions.

The proposal does //not// include a default implementation for either the class or the function autoloading mechanism.

==== New autoloading API ====

=== Classes ===

The API related to class autoloading is mostly identical to the existing SPL design with some minor design issues addressed. It introduces the following functions:

  * <php>autoload_register_class(callable $callback, bool $prepend = false): void</php>
  * <php>autoload_unregister_class(callable $callback): bool</php> for which <php>spl_autoload_unregister()</php> is an alias
  * <php>autoload_call_class(string $class): void</php> for which <php>spl_autoload_call()</php> is an alias
  * <php>autoload_list_class(): array</php> for which <php>spl_autoload_functions()</php> is an alias

The <php>spl_autoload_register()</php> does not become an alias for <php>autoload_register_class()</php> to preserve BC by continuing to return ''true'', allowing it to register the default SPL autoloader, and accepting the ignored second parameter, but they are both forwarded to an identical internal implementation.

Secondly, the behaviour to pass <php>autoload_call_class()</php>/<php>spl_autoload_call()</php> to <php>autoload_unregister_class()</php> as a magic value to empty the autoloader list will be deprecated.

It will still be possible to unregister all autoloaders by traversing the list returned by <php>autoload_list_class()</php> and call <php>autoload_unregister_class()</php> on each entry.

=== Functions ===

The API related to function autoloading introduces the following functions:

  * <php>autoload_register_function(callable $callback, bool $prepend = false): void</php> - Register given function as a function autoloader implementation
  * <php>autoload_unregister_function(callable $callback): bool</php> - Unregister given function as a function autoloader implementation
  * <php>autoload_call_function(string $function): void</php> - Try all registered function autoloader functions to load the requested function
  * <php>autoload_list_function(): array</php>  - Return all registered function autoloader functions

The 'class autoloader' list and 'function autoloader' list are separate lists.

==== Modified function ====

The <php>function_exists()</php> function will be modified by adding a ''$autoload'' parameter which defaults to ''true'' same as the <php>class_exists()</php> function.

==== Function autoloading mechanism ====

When namespaces were introduced in PHP 5.3.0, to avoid requiring leading slashes before all basic functions, function calls in a namespace would 'fallback' to the global scope.

e.g. for the code:

<PHP>
namespace bar {
    echo "length of hmm is " . strlen("hmm") . "\n";
}
</PHP>

If a function named ''strlen'' exists in the namespace ''bar'' PHP would use that, otherwise PHP would fallback to the <php>strlen()</php> function in the global namespace. Note, the ''use function strlen;'' syntax was introduced in PHP 5.6.

This RFC preserves that fallback behaviour.

When code tries to call a function that doesn't currently exist in the current namespace, the function autoloader mechanism will call the registered function autoloaders once with the fully namespaced function name.

If an appropriately named function is not loaded during that call, the PHP engine will 'fallback' that function to the global namespace. If a function already exists with the global namespace name, that will be used, otherwise the function autoloader mechanism will call the registered function autoloaders once with the global function name.

After a function autoload attempt succeeds, the function will be 'pinned' to the function that was resolved on the first successful autoload attempt, and no more function autoload calls will be generated.

This is possibly easier to understand through code:

<PHP>
namespace {
    function loader($name) {
        echo "function loader called with '$name'\n";

        if (strcasecmp($name, 'foo') === 0 && function_exists('foo') === false) {
            // use eval to avoid foo already being defined
            eval('function foo() {
                echo "I am foo in global namespace.\n";
            }');
        }

        if (strcasecmp($name, 'Quux\foo') === 0 && function_exists('Quux\foo') === false) {
            // use eval to avoid foo already being defined
            eval('
            namespace Quux {
              function foo() {
               echo "I am foo in Quux namespace.\n";
              }
            }');
        }
    }

    autoload_register_function('loader');

    foo(); // Autoload called in global namespace
}

namespace bar {
    foo(); // Autoload called in bar namespace

    for ($i = 0; $i < 3; $i += 1) {
        foo(); // Autoload not called, as function already pinned for namespace
    }
}
namespace bar {
    foo(); // Autoload not called, as function already pinned for namespace
}

namespace Quux {
    foo(); // Autoload called in Quux namespace
    foo(); // Autoload not called, as function already pinned for namespace
    non_existent_function(); // Autoload called twice, once with namespace, once without
}


// Output is
function loader called with 'foo'
I am foo in global namespace.
function loader called with 'bar\foo'
I am foo in global namespace.
I am foo in global namespace.
I am foo in global namespace.
I am foo in global namespace.
I am foo in global namespace.
function loader called with 'Quux\foo'
I am foo in Quux namespace.
I am foo in Quux namespace.
function loader called with 'Quux\non_existent_function'
function loader called with 'non_existent_function'

Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function Quux\non_existant_function()...
</PHP>

The position of this RFC is that this behaviour is correct both from a performance point-of-view, and a 'being able to reason about code' point-of-view.

Having the function autoloader called on each use of an unqualified function call in a namespace would be a performance hit that would be unacceptable to most PHP users.

Having it possible for what appears to be the same function call, to actually be dispatched to different functions, would be far too surprising a behaviour to the RFC authors.

As a result of the pinning, ''function_exists'' will return true for functions in namespaces that have been pinned to a global function. In the above example <php>function_exists('bar\foo')</php> would return true, after the first use of it in the namespace. This is the correct behaviour from both a "will this trigger autoloading (no)" and a "is it safe to get reflection about that function" point of view, though arguably from other positions it might be less correct.

==== Aliased/Imported functions ====

PHP has the feature of aliasing/importing functions.

When a function is imported, the function autoloader will not attempt to load a function in the current namespace, it will only try to use a function with the aliased/imported name. For global functions defined in the standard library (and so loaded when PHP starts up), this means the function autoloader callback won't be called.

For functions that are not aliased/imported, the function autoloader will be called once per function name per namespace. After that, the function will be pinned to the function that was resolved.

<PHP>
namespace {
    function loader($name) {
        echo "function loader called with '$name'\n";
    }

    autoload_register_function('loader');
}

namespace Foo {

    use function strlen;

    // As the function strlen is imported and the function \strlen is
    // already loaded as part of the standard library, no call to
    // the autoloader happens
    echo "strlen length is " . strlen('strlen') . "\n";

    // As the function strpos is not imported, there is a
    // single call to the autoloader with 'Foo/strpos' as the
    // name. As no function is loaded, the fallback to \strpos
    // occurs, and the name 'Foo/strpos' is pinned to '\strpos'
    echo "pos position is " .strpos("strpos", "pos") . "\n";

    // As 'Foo/strpos' is now pinned to '\strpos', no autoload call occurs
    echo "pos position is " .strpos("strpos", "pos") . "\n";
    echo "pos position is " .strpos("strpos", "pos") . "\n";
    echo "pos position is " .strpos("strpos", "pos") . "\n";
}

// Output is:
//
// strlen length is 6
// function loader called with 'Foo\strpos'
// pos position is 3
// pos position is 3
// pos position is 3
// pos position is 3

</PHP>

===== Backward Incompatible Changes =====

Passing <php>spl_autoload_call()</php> to <php>spl_autoload_unregister()</php> is deprecated.

===== Proposed PHP Version =====

Next minor version, i.e. PHP 8.3.

===== Future scope =====

The use of the word ''class'' is currently accurate, but it seems likely that at some point PHP will have type aliases e.g.

<PHP>
type number = int | float;
</PHP>

When that happens, it may be more accurate to use the word ''type'' rather than ''class'' i.e. autoload_register_type.

====== Deprecating the SPL autoloader functions ======

Although at some point the current SPL autoloader functions could be deprecated and then removed in a later version of PHP, there is little cost in leaving those functions as aliases (and an internally redirected call) to the updated functions. Because of that, this RFC does not propose deprecating them in PHP 8.3, and instead leaves that to a future RFC.

====== Constant and stream autoloading ======

It would be possible to add autoloading for constants and streams, however to limit the scope of this RFC it only adds support for functions.


===== F.A.Q. =====

==== Why change the function names from SPL? ====

At some point, the SPL may be decoupled from PHP core. As autoloading should be part of core PHP, and not part of a library, moving the function names to not include SPL seems appropriate.

==== Is the behaviour of class autoloading changed? ====

No. At least, not intentionally other than deprecating the magic behaviour of autoload_unregister_class when it is passed a special value, to unregister all class loaders, everything should work the same. If you see a change, please report a bug.

# What is the change in performance overhead for function autoloading?

For programs that do not have a function autoloader registered, there will be no autoloader to dispatch, so there will be almost no performance change.

Whether or not a fuction autoloader is registered, resolving the function is only done once per function per namespace, assuming the function is loaded/resolved.

As the code example shows, after a successful attempt to autoload a function in a namespace, or the global function fallback occurs, the function is 'pinned' to that function, and subsequent use doesn't trigger autoloading.

It is possible to trigger the autoloader multiple times for the same class/function if you catch the Error for class/function not found, and repeat the attempt to use the class/function that doesn't exist, but that is outside of most normal coding practices.

===== Proposed Voting Choices =====

As per the voting RFC a yes/no vote with a 2/3 majority is needed for this proposal to be accepted.
